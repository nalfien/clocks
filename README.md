# clocks
A set of analog JavaScript clocks. Using HTML5 Canvas.

Three clocks:
 
 Strandard: A normal clock.
 
 Decimal: Uses a decimal-based clock, with 100 seconds equaling one "minute", and 100 "minutes" equaling one "hour".
 
 Silly: Originally a test of my JSON-based clock definition system. Doesn't make any sense, just a test of the JSON-defined clocks.
